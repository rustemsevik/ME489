\section{Summary}
In this homework we have modified the solution of the homework 2 by using the several MPI directives and several MPI functions. We have examined the existing structure of the code and proposed a suitable type of MPI function for each loop to make the parallelization safe. We have successfully decreased the execution time. We have presented the proposed methods and the reasons why we have utilized that specific function in this report. We have measured the execution time for different number of processes used for parallelization. We have presented the execution duration versus number of threads used plots. We have observed the behavior regarding the execution duration governed by Gustafson's law. To conclude it is important to carefully use the parallelization and one has to be aware of the bottleneck factors of the interfacing methods.
