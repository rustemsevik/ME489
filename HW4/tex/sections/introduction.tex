\section{Introduction}
In this homework the students are expected to modify the existing K-means clustering code from the previous homeworks by using the message passing interface (MPI) functions and directives in order to enhance the performance of the code. In the previous homeworks students have utilized a serially structured code which runs on a single thread and parallel structured code which is utilizing the Open-MP library. This homework aims students to extend their knowledge and skills of writing high performance codes by synchronizing and interfacing the code across multiple processes by using the library Open MPI.
