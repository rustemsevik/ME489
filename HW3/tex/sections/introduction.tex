\section{Introduction}
In this homework the students are expected to modify the existing K-means clustering code from the previous homework by using the OpenMP functions and directives in order to enhance the performance of the code. The previous homework uses a serially structured code and it runs on a single thread. This homework aims students to extend their knowledge and skills of writing high performance codes by utilizing the parallelization and synchronization of the serial code across multiple threads on multi-core processors by using the library Open Multi-Processing (OpenMP).
