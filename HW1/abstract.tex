\begin{abstract}
R. Anderson, J. Andrej, A. Barker, et al. \cite{mfem_library} describe MFEM as a C++ library supporting modular finite element methods, particularly suitable for highorder meshes and spaces. Its open-source nature, coupled with its light , flexible, and scalable design, makes it a valuable tool for high-performance computing. Researchers can use it to experiment with high-order, parallel, and GPU-accelerated algorithms. This paper focuses on MFEMâ€™s theoretical underpinnings and its practical applications.
