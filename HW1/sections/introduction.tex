\section{Introduction}
The Finite Element Method (FEM), a method for approximating partial differential equation solutions, is central to MFEM. FEM uses unstructured grids for discretization. MFEM stands out due to its advantages in usability, accessibility, and high-performance computing (HPC) efficiency. Its open-source code is readily available on platforms like Spack, OpenHPC, and Github. MFEM finds applications in various fields, including manufacturing and heat transfer, and supports diverse meshes, solvers, and numerical methods. It also supports MPI-based parallelism and GPU acceleration using CUDA, OCCA, RAJA, and OpenMP.
