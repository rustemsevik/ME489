\section{Introduction}
In this homework it is expected to modify the existing K-means clustering code from the previous homeworks by using the GPU events in order to enhance the performance of the code. In the previous homeworks we have utilized a serially structured code which runs on a single thread and parallel structured code which is utilizing the Open-MP library also a parallel code which utilizes MPI. This homework aims to extend our knowledge and skills of writing high performance codes by using GPU and CUDA events.
