\section{Summary}
In this homework we have modified the solution of the homework 2 in order use the GPU to accelerate the computations. We have examined the existing structure of the code and proposed suitable types of \texttt{cuda} function and several kernel functions for each function in the original code. In the large datasets we have have successfully decreased the execution time. On the contrary in the datasets with less number of data points we observed an increase in the execution time. We have presented the proposed methods and the reasons why we have utilized that specific function and method in this report. We have measured the execution time for different implementations and compared the results. To conclude it is important to carefully use the GPU acceleration using \texttt{cuda} and one has to be aware of the bottleneck factors of the interfacing methods.
